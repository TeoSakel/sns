# Route: wes-pairs-snv

Somatic point mutations and small insertions/deletions for the `wes` or `rna-snv` results.

## Usage

After individual samples are processed with the `wes` or `rna-snv` route,
manually define tumor-normal sample pairs in the `samples.pairs.csv` sample sheet.

Run `wes-pairs-snv` route from the same directory as `wes`.

```
sns/run wes-pairs-snv
```

## Output

Primary results:

* `VCF-*`: VCF files generated by Mutect and Strelka variant callers.
* `VCF-*-annot.all.txt`: Table of functionally annotated variants.
* `VCF-*-annot.coding.txt`: Table of coding region variants (subset of all variants).
* `VCF-*-annot.nonsyn.txt`: Table of non-synonymous, frameshift, and splicing variants (subset of coding variants).

Run metrics:

* `summary.VCF-*-annot.csv`: Number of mutations per sample for different variant callers.
